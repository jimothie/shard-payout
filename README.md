# SWGOH Shard Payout

A Discord bot which parses an xlsx document to write payouts in a Discord channel.

## Installation

- install Node >= 8
- git clone the repository
- run `npm install` in its folder
- visit www.discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and make a new application. Convert it to a bot
- make a file `src/secret.js` with `export const botToken = 'Your bot token here'`
- add the bot to your Discord server
- make a dedicated channel for the payouts and give the bot full access to it
- get the channel ID for the payout channel (enable dev options in Discord, right-click the channel and copy ID)
- go to `src/Bot.js` and change the value for `channelId` to the channel ID you just copied
- make your changes to the xlsx file. Do not change its layout or column names
- run `npm start`

OR

- (optional) if you want to run it indefinitely, I suggest to use pm2:
  - run `npm i -g pm2`
  - run `npm run compile`
  - run `pm2 start ./lib --name="swgoh-payout"`
